== about me

Jarek Pałka (@j_palka)

Neo4j (a graph database) staff engineer/team lead/benchmarking team

over 20 years with JVM ( and people) +
speaker, coder, architect

founder of SegFault (https://segfault.events) conference +
godfather of Programistyczna Grupa Rozwoju +
and proud father of new baby, **JVM Club** (working title) 

== DISCLAIMER

this presentation may contain strong language, +
my own opinions, references to sex, drugs, religion, alcohol and politics

if this does make you feel offended +
that's good it means you have something you care about in your life


=== agenda

<<the_raise_and_fall_on_managed_runtime,a sip of history>> +
<<malloc_baby,malloc, baby!>> +
<<hello_c,hello, C!>>

== the raise and fall on managed runtime

yet another taxonomy of programming languages

* compiled (C/C++)
* compiled with managed runtime (Go, Pony)
* interpreted with managed runtime (LISP,Smalltalk,Java,C#,JavaScript,Erlang,Python, PHP, Perl) (aka virtual machines)

=== managed runtime

all the hard things

* memory management (garbage collectors)
* threads management
* code management (runtime linking)
* calling native code (because we are interpreted)
* (operating system abstraction)*

=== why?

to give up control for safety +
(it is not the only reason)

=== !

* memory safety
* operation safety
* execution safety

=== !

when you give up control, +
you loose a lot of opportunities to optimize your code +
(notice I didn't say you loose performance)

== Java as a system's language?

stupid idea! +
(especially when management of resources is critical)

=== !

Apache Kafka +
Neo4j +
Elastic +
Hazelcast +
Cassandra +
Apache BigData Ecosystem

=== are these people stupid or?

=== !

=== !

*NO*

safety is more important than speed

you don't want your databases to randomly crash

=== but all we really need is

need for speed :)

=== sun.misc.Unsafe

internal API abused beyond creators imagination

* memory allocation
* object layout
* low level concurrency controls
* serialization

=== welcome, bare metal Java

* foreign memory
* foreign linker
* vectorization
* frozen arrays
* primitive objects (part of Valhalla)
* low-level concurrency controls (VarHandles)

== malloc, baby

=== DirectByteBuffer

freeing unused memory when no longer referenced +
inefficient under pressure

=== Unsafe.allocateMemory

breaks memory safety guarantees, +
not official API,

=== JNI

image::https://media.giphy.com/media/yvBAuESRTsETqNFlEl/giphy.gif[background]

=== trial and error

* first proposed by JEP 370 and targeted to Java 14
* and later re-incubated by JEP 383 which was targeted to Java 15
* third proposal https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/393[JEP 393: Foreign-Memory Access API (Third Incubator)] released with Java 16
* fourth proposal https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/412[JEP 412: Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator)] (merge of two JEPs, but more about it later)
* fifth proposal JEP https://openjdk.org/jeps/419[419: Foreign Function & Memory API (Second Incubator)]
* Java 19, finally in preview
* Java 20, one more preview :)

=== when this is going to end?

all examples here are based on Java 20

=== goals

[quote,,JEP 434]
Ease of use — Replace the Java Native Interface (JNI) with a superior, pure-Java development model.

=== goals

[quote,,]
    Performance — Provide performance that is comparable to, if not better than, existing APIs such as JNI and sun.misc.Unsafe.

=== goals

[quote,,]
    Generality — Provide ways to operate on different kinds of foreign memory (e.g., native memory, persistent memory, and managed heap memory) and, over time, to accommodate other platforms (e.g., 32-bit x86) and foreign functions written in languages other than C (e.g., C++, Fortran).

=== goals

[quote,,]
    Safety — Allow programs to perform unsafe operations on foreign memory, but warn users about such operations by default.

=== non-goals

[quote,,]
Re-implement JNI on top of this API, or otherwise change JNI in any way;

=== non-goals

[quote,,]
Re-implement legacy Java APIs, such as sun.misc.Unsafe, on top of this API;

=== non-goals

[quote,,]
Provide tooling that mechanically generates Java code from native-code header files; or

=== non-goals

[quote,,]
Change how Java applications that interact with native libraries are 
packaged and deployed (e.g., via multi-platform JAR files).

== The Foreign-Memory Access API

[quote,,]
Objects created with the new keyword are stored in the JVM's heap, where they are subject to garbage collection when no longer needed. However, the cost and unpredictability associated with garbage collection is unacceptable for performance-critical libraries such as Tensorflow, Ignite, Lucene, and Netty. They need to store data outside the heap, in off-heap memory which they allocate and deallocate themselves. Access to off-heap memory also allows data to be serialized and deserialized by mapping files directly into memory via, e.g., mmap.

=== !

* MemorySegment 
* SegmentScope
* MemoryLayout

=== MemorySegment

models a contiguous memory region with given spatial and temporal bounds, +
any access outside spatial or temporal bounds will end up with exception

memory addresses are now modeled by zero-length memory segments, it used to `MemoryAddress` class

=== !

memory segment can be:

* on-heap
* off-heap
* memory mapped file
* NVRAM (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/352[JEP 352: Non-Volatile Mapped Byte Buffers])

=== bounds

Every memory segments has bounds, spatial and temporal

* Every memory segment has a size
* Every memory segment is associated with a scope
* Access operations on a memory segment are subject to the thread-confinement checks enforced by the associated scope

=== arena

An arena controls the lifecycle of memory segments, providing both flexible allocation and timely deallocation.

An arena has a scope, called the arena scope. When the arena is closed, the arena scope is no longer alive. As a result, all the segments associated with the arena scope are invalidated, safely and atomically, their backing memory regions are deallocated (where applicable) and can no longer be accessed after the arena is closed

=== thread confinement

if you use _confined or implicit scope_, +
memory segments are confined to thread it created, +
any access from other threads is forbidden,

you can use _shared scope_ to make segment shareable between threads

=== dereferencing memory

* to obtain a memory access var handle, clients must start from `MemoryLayout.varHandle(Class<?> carrier, PathElement... elements)`
* This determines the variable type (all primitive types but void and boolean are supported), as well as the alignment constraint, and the byte order associated to a memory access var handle.
* `carrier` type is _primitive_ type which will carry value of memory segment
* The resulting memory access var handle can then be combined in various ways to emulate different addressing modes.
* The var handles created by this class feature a mandatory coordinate type (of type MemorySegment), and one long coordinate type, which represents the offset, in bytes, relative to the segment, at which dereference should occur.

=== MemoryLayout

a programmatic description of a memory segment's contents

* sequences
* structs
* unions

=== C struct

[source,C]
----
struct {
    int value;
    struct {
        int year;
        int month;
        int day;
    } date;
}
----

=== alignment, padding and access modes

* data structure alignment, unaligned access will throw exception,
* memory layout supports padding,
* var handles on memory segments can use `MemoryAccess` modes (atomic, volatile, acquire-get)

=== unsafe memory segments

*Since the Java runtime has no way to know the spatial and temporal bounds associated with a memory address, directly dereferencing memory addresses is forbidden by the FFM API*

=== !

what if dont' have `MemorySegment` but just a memory address? +

=== unlock your seat belts

=== safety

[quote,,]
To enable access to unsafe methods for code in some module M, specify java --enable-native-access=M on the command line.

=== things we didn't discuss

* `SegmentAllocator`
* memory access mode (whole new separate presentation)

=== hello C

* JNI, old, slow, hard to implement,no major improvements since release,
* and collection of JNI wrappers,

=== eat your own dog food

JNI is used in many places in JDK (and JVM), +
these things are inherently slow and bloated +
my favorite part java.io and java.net

=== state of affairs

The initial scope of this effort aims at providing high quality, fully optimized interoperability with C libraries, on x64 and AArch64 platforms.

The Foreign Linker API and implementation should be flexible enough to, over time, accommodate support for other platforms (e.g., 32-bit x86) and foreign functions written in languages other than C (e.g. C++, Fortran).

=== say hi to `Linker`

* downcalls (e.g. calls from Java to native code), the downcallHandle method can be used to model native functions as plain MethodHandle objects.
* upcalls (e.g. calls from native back to Java code), the upcallStub method can be used to convert an existing MethodHandle (which might point to some Java method) into a MemorySegment, which can then be passed to a native function as a function pointer.

=== center of the universe

* Linker
* SymbolLookup
* FunctionDescriptor

=== downcalls

[quote,,]
Linking a foreign function is a process which requires a function descriptor, a set of memory layouts which, together, specify the signature of the foreign function to be linked, and returns, when complete, a downcall method handle, that is, a method handle that can be used to invoke the target foreign function.

=== upcalls

[quote,,]
Creating an upcall stub requires a method handle and a function descriptor; in this case, the set of memory layouts in the function descriptor specify the signature of the function pointer associated with the upcall stub. 
Upcall stubs are modelled by instances of type MemorySegmentPREVIEW; upcall stubs can be passed by reference to other downcall method handles and, they are released via their associated scope

=== !

=== too much magic

as you can imagine, it means handwriting all `FunctionDescriptor` and structs and unions
from C header files, to be able to work any advanced C library

=== a real gem

panama early access builds contain `jextract` command line, which generates
classes (and source files), from any C header file,

with some limitations

https://jdk.java.net/panama/[Project Panama Early-Access Builds]

=== jextract

it generates Java code from C header files

    jextract -d ${build.directory}/generated-sources -t pl.symentis.foreign.posix --source /usr/include/mqueue.h

=== what's in it for you?

=== nothing?

=== !

* when working with huge in-memory data sets, this way you can avoid GC
* interacting with non-JVM and JVM processes over share memory (via memory mapped files)
* C coding is no longer required to call native code in a platform agnostic way (but you still need to understand pointers, addressing modes and how memory works)
* all the libraries code you use, like database drivers, ML algorithms and Big Data, will benefit from safer and stable API 
* it would be easier to use low-level OS functions, Java will faster adapt to every changing OSs and hardware ecosystems, one example is io_uring

=== food for thought

* will Java replace Python in data science? probably not, but it maybe easier to make production grade ML models with Java
* will next Cyberpunk be written in JVM? probably not, but it is fun to think about

== keep on rockin' and stay safe
