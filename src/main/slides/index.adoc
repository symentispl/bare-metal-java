== about me

Jarek Pałka (@j_palka)

Neo4j (a graph database) performance engineer/team lead

over 20 years with JVM ( and people) +
speaker, coder, architect

founder of SegFault conference +
godfather of Programistyczna Grupa Rozwoju

== DISCLAIMER

this presentation may contain strong language, +
my own opinions, references
to sex, drugs, religion, alcohol and politics

if this does make you feel offended +
that's good it means you have something you care about in your life

== the raise and fall on managed runtime

yet another taxonomy of programming languages

* compiled (C/C++)
* compiled with managed runtime (Go, Pony)
* interpreted with managed runtime (LISP,Smalltalk,Java,C#,JavaScript,Erlang,Python, PHP, Perl) (aka virtual machines)

=== managed runtime

all the hard things

* memory management (garbage collectors)
* threads management
* code management (runtime linking)
* calling native code (because we are interpreted)
* (operating system abstraction)*

=== why?

to give up control for safety

=== !

* memory safety
* operation safety
* execution safety

=== !

when you give up control, +
you loose a lot of opportunities to optimize your code +
(notice I didn't say you loose performance)

== Java as a system's language?

stupid idea!
(especially when management of resources is critical)

=== !

Apache Kafka +
Neo4j +
Elastic +
Hazelcast +
Cassandra +
Apache BigData Ecosystem

=== are these people stupid or?

crazy?

=== !

no

safety is more important than speed

you don't want your databases to randomly crash

=== but all we need is

need for speed :)

=== sun.misc.Unsafe

internal API abused beyond creators imagination

* memory allocation
* object layout
* low level concurrency controls
* serialization

=== welcome, bare metal Java

* foreign memory allocation
* foreign linker
* vectorization
* low-level concurrency controls
* frozen arrays, i całą seria optymalizacji, która za tym idzie
* primitive objects (i projekt Valhalla)

== vectorization

[code,java]
----
x1=y1+z1;
x2=y2+z2;
x3=y3+z3;
x4=y4+z4;
----

=== !

[code,java]
----
[y1,y2,y3,y4]+[z1,z2,z3,z4]
----

=== nothing new

Intel's SSE and AVX extensions+
add new instruction and wide registers

JVM has support for it for a long time +
JIT generates specific intrinsics +
vectorized loops

but you have almost no control over it

=== JEP 414: Vector API (Second Incubator)

https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/414[]

? benchmark + hsdis ? porównać różne operacje (dzielenie ? )
