== DISCLAIMER

this presentation may contain strong language, +
my own opinions, references to sex, drugs, religion, alcohol and politics

if this does make you feel offended +
that's good it means you have something you care about in your life


=== agenda

<<the_raise_and_fall_on_managed_runtime,a sip of history>> +
<<malloc_baby,malloc, baby!>> +
<<hello_c,hello, C!>>

== the raise and fall on managed runtime

yet another taxonomy of programming languages

* compiled (C/C++)
* compiled with managed runtime (Go, Pony)
* interpreted with managed runtime (LISP,Smalltalk,Java,C#,JavaScript,Erlang,Python, PHP, Perl) (aka virtual machines)

=== managed runtime

all the hard things

* memory management (garbage collectors)
* threads management
* code management (runtime linking)
* calling native code (because we are interpreted)
* (operating system abstraction)*

=== why?

to give up control for safety +
(it is not the only reason)

=== !

* memory safety
* operation safety
* execution safety

=== !

when you give up control, +
you loose a lot of opportunities to optimize your code +
(notice I didn't say you loose performance)

== Java as a system's language?

stupid idea! +
(especially when management of resources is critical)

=== !

all examples here are based on Java 17 +
(and if noted, Java 19 Early access Panama build)

=== goals

[quote,,JEP 412]
Generality: A single API should be able to operate on various kinds of foreign memory (e.g., native memory, persistent memory, managed heap memory, etc.).

=== goals

[quote,,JEP 412]
Safety: It should not be possible for the API to undermine the safety of the JVM, regardless of the kind of memory being operated upon.

=== goals

[quote,,JEP 412]
Control: Clients should have options as to how memory segments are to be deallocated: either explicitly (via a method call) or implicitly (when the segment is no longer in use).

=== goals

[quote,,JEP 412]
Usability: For programs that need to access foreign memory, the API should be a compelling alternative to legacy Java APIs such as sun.misc.Unsafe.

=== motivation

[quote,,JEP 412]
Many Java programs access foreign memory, such as Ignite, mapDB, memcached, Lucene, and Netty's ByteBuf API.

=== !

By doing so they can:

* Avoid the cost and unpredictability associated with garbage collection (especially when maintaining large caches);
* Share memory across multiple processes; and
* Serialize and deserialize memory content by mapping files into memory (via, e.g., mmap).

=== The Foreign-Memory Access API

* MemorySegment & ResourceScope
* MemoryAddress
* MemoryLayout

=== MemorySegment

models a contiguous memory region with given spatial and temporal bounds, +
any access outside spatial or temporal bounds will end upt with exception

[source,java]
----
import jdk.incubator.foreign.*;

try (var resourceScope = ResourceScope.newConfinedScope()) {
    var memorySegment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(1024, resourceScope);
}
----

=== !

[source,java]
----
import jdk.incubator.foreign.*;

var resourceScope = ResourceScope.newImplicitScope();
var memorySegment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(1024, resourceScope);
resourceScope.close(); // hi, manual memory management
----

=== !

[source,java]
----
import jdk.incubator.foreign.*;
import java.lang.ref.Cleaner;

var cleaner = Cleaner.create(); //uses PhantomReferences and ReferenceQueue
var resourceScope = ResourceScope.newImplicitScope(cleaner);
var memorySegment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(1024)); // GC will cleanup this segment
----

=== !

memory segment can be:

* on-heap
* off-heap
* memory mapped file
* NVRAM (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/352[JEP 352: Non-Volatile Mapped Byte Buffers])

=== thread confinement

if you use _confined or implicit scope_, +
memory segments are confined to thread it created, +
any access from other threads is forbidden,

you can use _shared scope_ to make segment shareable between threads

=== dereferencing memory

* `MemoryHandles` is based on same concepts as `VarHandle`
* to obtain a memory access var handle, clients must start from `MemoryLayout.varHandle(Class<?> carrier, PathElement... elements)` or 'MemoryHandles.varHandle(Class<?> carrier, ByteOrder byteOrder)' or `MemoryHandles.varHandle(Class<?> carrier, long alignmentBytes, ByteOrder byteOrder)`
* This determines the variable type (all primitive types but void and boolean are supported), as well as the alignment constraint, and the byte order associated to a memory access var handle.
* `carrier` type is _primitive_ type which will carry value of memory segment
* The resulting memory access var handle can then be combined in various ways to emulate different addressing modes.
* The var handles created by this class feature a mandatory coordinate type (of type MemorySegment), and one long coordinate type, which represents the offset, in bytes, relative to the segment, at which dereference should occur.

=== sounds cryptic?

[source,java]
----
import jdk.incubator.foreign.*;
import java.nio.ByteOrder;
import java.lang.invoke.VarHandle;

var varHandleGet = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.nativeOrder());
out.println("Var handle for GET access mode: " + varHandleGet.toMethodHandle(VarHandle.AccessMode.GET).type());

var varHandleSet = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.nativeOrder());
out.println("Var handle for SET access mode: " + varHandleSet.toMethodHandle(VarHandle.AccessMode.SET).type());

try (var resourceScope = ResourceScope.newConfinedScope()) {
    var memorySegment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(1024, resourceScope);
    var offset = 512;
    var value = 2048;
    varHandleGet.set(memorySegment, offset, value);

    out.println("value = " + varHandleGet.get(memorySegment, offset));

    var varHandle = MemoryHandles.insertCoordinates(varHandleGet, 1, offset);
    out.println("modified var handle for GET access mode" + varHandle.toMethodHandle(VarHandle.AccessMode.GET).type());
    out.println("value = " + varHandle.get(memorySegment));
}

[quote,,JEP-412]
To make the FFM API more approachable, the MemoryAccess class provides static accessors to dereference memory segments without the need to construct memory-access var handles.

=== MemoryLayout

a programmatic description of a memory segment's contents

* sequences
* structs
* unions

=== C struct

    int value;
    struct {
        int year;

=== memory layout

import jdk.incubator.foreign.*;

 var struct = MemoryLayout.structLayout(
                CLinker.C_INT.withName("age"),
                CLinker.C_INT.withName("kids"),
                CLinker.C_POINTER.withName("birthDate"),

 var streetVarHandle = struct.varHandle(long.class, groupElement("address"), groupElement("street"));
 out.println("set address.street field in struct method handle type: " + streetVarHandle.toMethodHandle(VarHandle.AccessMode.SET).type());
 out.println("get address.street field in struct method handle type: " + streetVarHandle.toMethodHandle(VarHandle.AccessMode.GET).type());

 try (var resourceScope = ResourceScope.newConfinedScope()) {
     var memorySegment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(struct, resourceScope);
     var string = CLinker.toCString("Wielkiego Stacha 16b, Psie Pole", resourceScope);
     var asAddressVarHandle = MemoryHandles.asAddressVarHandle(streetVarHandle);

     asAddressVarHandle.set(memorySegment, string.address());
 }

=== alignment, padding and access modes

* data structure alignment, unaligned access will throw exception,
* memory layout supports padding,
* var handles on memory segments can use `MemoryAccess` modes (atomic, volatile, acquire-get), please read documentation, there are rules around padding and sizes

=== unsafe memory segments

[quote,,JEP 412]
Dereference operations are only possible on memory segments. Since a memory segment has spatial and temporal bounds, the Java runtime can always ensure that memory associated with a given segment is dereferenced safely. However, there are situations where clients might only have a MemoryAddress instance, as is often the case when interacting with native code. Since the Java runtime has no way to know the spatial and temporal bounds associated with a memory address, directly dereferencing memory addresses is forbidden by the FFM API.

=== !

*Since the Java runtime has no way to know the spatial and temporal bounds associated with a memory address, directly dereferencing memory addresses is forbidden by the FFM API*

=== !

what if dont' have `MemorySegment` but just a `MemoryAddress`? +
(like in examples in section to follow)

=== !

* If the address is known to fall within a memory segment, the client can perform a rebase operation via MemoryAddress::segmentOffset. The rebasing operation re-interprets the address's offset relative to the segment's base address to yield a new offset which can be applied to the existing segment — which can then be safely dereferenced
* Alternatively, if no such segment exists then the client can create one unsafely, using the MemoryAddress::asSegment factory. This factory effectively attaches fresh spatial and temporal bounds to an otherwise raw memory address, so as to allow dereference operations. The memory segment returned by this factory is unsafe: A raw memory address might be associated with a memory region that is 10 bytes long, but the client might accidentally overestimate the size of the region and create an unsafe memory segment that is 100 bytes long. This might result, later, in attempts to dereference memory outside the bounds of the memory region associated with the unsafe segment, which might cause a JVM crash or, worse, result in silent memory corruption. For this reason, creating unsafe segments is regarded as a restricted operation, and is disabled by default

=== safety

[quote,,JEP-412]
To enable access to unsafe methods for code in some module M, specify java --enable-native-access=M on the command line.

=== eat your own dog food

JNI is used in many places in JDK (and JVM), +
these things are inherently slow and bloated +
my favorite part java.io and java.net

=== state of affairs

The initial scope of this effort aims at providing high quality, fully optimized interoperability with C libraries, on x64 and AArch64 platforms.

The Foreign Linker API and implementation should be flexible enough to, over time, accommodate support for other platforms (e.g., 32-bit x86) and foreign functions written in languages other than C (e.g. C++, Fortran).

=== say hi to `CLinker`

* downcalls (e.g. calls from Java to native code), the downcallHandle method can be used to model native functions as plain MethodHandle objects.
* upcalls (e.g. calls from native back to Java code), the upcallStub method can be used to convert an existing MethodHandle (which might point to some Java method) into a MemorySegment, which can then be passed to a native function as a function pointer.

[quote,Richard Starin,Vectorised Algorithms in Java]
Because AVX can reduce the processor frequency, it’s not always profitable to vectorise, so compilers employ cost models to decide when they should do so.
Such cost models require platform specific calibration, and sometimes C2 can get it wrong

=== vector api

https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/414[JEP 414: Vector API (Second Incubator)]

=== goals

Clear and concise API — The API should be capable of clearly and concisely expressing a wide range of vector computations consisting of sequences of vector operations composed within loops and possibly with control flow.
It should be possible to express a computation that is generic with respect to vector size, or the number of lanes per vector, thus enabling such computations to be portable across hardware supporting different vector sizes

=== goals

Platform agnostic — The API should be CPU architecture agnostic, enabling implementations on multiple architectures supporting vector instructions.
As is usual in Java APIs, where platform optimization and portability conflict then the bias will be toward making the API portable, even if that results in some platform-specific idioms not being expressible in portable code.

=== goals

Reliable runtime compilation and performance on x64 and AArch64 architectures — On capable x64 architectures the Java runtime, specifically the HotSpot C2 compiler, should compile vector operations to corresponding efficient and performant vector instructions, such as those supported by Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) and Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX).
Developers should have confidence that the vector operations they express will reliably map closely to relevant vector instructions.
On capable ARM AArch64 architectures C2 will, similarly, compile vector operations to the vector instructions supported by NEON.

=== goals

Graceful degradation — Sometimes a vector computation cannot be fully expressed at runtime as a sequence of vector instructions, perhaps because the architecture does not support some of the required instructions.
In such cases the Vector API implementation should degrade gracefully and still function.
This may involve issuing warnings if a vector computation cannot be efficiently compiled to vector instructions.
On platforms without vectors, graceful degradation will yield code competitive with manually-unrolled loops, where the unroll factor is the number of lanes in the selected vector.

A lane-wise operation applies a scalar operator, such as addition, to each lane of one or more vectors in parallel.
A lane-wise operation usually, but not always, produces a vector of the same length and shape.
Lane-wise operations are further classified as unary, binary, ternary, test, or conversion operations.

[quote,,JEP 414]
A cross-lane operation applies an operation across an entire vector.
A cross-lane operation produces either a scalar or a vector of possibly a different shape.
Cross-lane operations are further classified as permutation or reduction operations.

=== vector shapes

[quote,,JEP 414]
The shape of a vector governs how an instance of Vector<E> is mapped to a hardware vector register when vector computations are compiled by the HotSpot C2 compiler.
The length of a vector, i.e., the number of lanes or elements, is the vector size divided by the element size.

=== at runtime

[quote,,JEP 414]
The Vector API has two implementations.
The first implements operations in Java, thus it is functional but not optimal.
The second defines intrinsic vector operations for the HotSpot C2 run-time compiler so that it can compile vector computations to appropriate hardware registers and vector instructions when available.

=== !

[quote,,JEP 414]
To avoid an explosion of C2 intrinsics we define generalized intrinsics corresponding to the various kinds of operations such as unary, binary, conversion, and so on, which take a parameter describing the specific operation to be performed.
Approximately twenty new intrinsics support the intrinsification of the entire API.

[quote,,JEP 414]
it seems that auto-vectorization of scalar code is not a reliable tactic for optimizing ad-hoc user-written loops unless the user pays unusually careful attention to unwritten contracts about exactly which loops a compiler is prepared to auto-vectorize.
It is too easy to write a loop that fails to auto-vectorize, for a reason that no human reader can detect.
Years of work on auto-vectorization, even in HotSpot, have left us with lots of optimization machinery that works only on special occasions.
We want to enjoy the use of this machinery more often!
